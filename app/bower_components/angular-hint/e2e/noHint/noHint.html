<div>
  <div id="title">No Hint Example</div>
  <div id="test">
    This is a test div that the controller will attempt to remove. Such manipulation
    of the DOM would cause ng-hint-dom to log a message if it was loaded. Since ng-hint is not
    being loaded, there should not be a message.
  </div>

  <div id="directiveTest" ng-cick="">
    This is another test div that uses a mispelled directive. If ng-hint-directives was
    loaded, a message would be logged.
