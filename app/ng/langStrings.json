The awards can be obtained cumulatively by individual learners. That means that in order to earn a gold medal, a pupil must obtain all other awards first. The awards a pupil obtained are published on the profile page and on this Hall of Fame page.\n\rAt stage 1 an inquiry star and diploma celebrate the ability to individually reflect on the relevance, consequences and ethics of processes and outcomes of inquiry for oneself, others and society. At stage 2 bronze, silver and gold medals celebrate excellent communication and discussion about the relevance, consequences and ethics of inquiry processes and outcomes for oneself, others and society with an audience.\n\rPupils can obtain up to all five awards during the time they participate in the Ark of Inquiry.\n\rTogether with their teachers pupils take active roles in getting nominated. Granting is organized by a national jury consisting of teachers, teacher educators and experts. The process of awarding is coordinated by a national administrator.\n\rIn addition to the awards, the Ark of Inquiry platform also features a set of OpenBadges. Badges can be obtained for completing a set of activities, for mastering a specific domain or just by showing initiative. Start collecting badges by starting your next inquiry activity!",
